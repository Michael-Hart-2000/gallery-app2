Will be able to List artists using a sub menu.

Will be able to update artists.

Will be able to delete artists.

Will be able to sort artists by Living/Deceased.

Will be able to save and load artists.

Will persist the artists into different formats (XML and JSON).

Will be able to add artefacts to each artist (painting, sculpture, etc)

Will be able to uodate artefacts, delete artefacts and mark artefacts as sold/unsold

## Project Purpose
The purpose of the app was to tie together all that we have learned from Software Development tools, bringing learning from Assignment 1's Employee app and Assignment 2's notes app into an app create and designed completely to our own liking.

It was also a chance to get a deeper understanding of the GitHub workflow, creating issues, linking to pull requests, merging pull requests, creating and deleting branches, closing issues, Git-> Fetch, and remote master branch Checkout.

## Getting Started with the Project
Users can get started by downloading the gallery app repository, and running the main.kt file found in the src folder.

A menu will be displayed and the numbers on your keyboard allow you to navigate through the apps functions.

## Getting Help
Users can get help with the app through the menu system implemented within the app which details what functions the app can do.
